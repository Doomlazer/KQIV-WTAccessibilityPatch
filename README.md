# KQIV Whale Tongue Accessibility Patch
 
Verion 1.0

This mod replaces the control pic of the whale's belly so that it's much easier to climb; just walk straight up. It also fixes a bug in the original game that would otherwise prevent this mod from working.

Installation:

Copy pic.044 and script.044 into your KQIV game folder and start the game normally. Uninstall by removing the files.

# KQIV Whale Tongue Accessibility Patch
 
Verion 1.0

This replaces the control pic of the whale's belly making it easier to climb. Climb straight up. It also fixes a bug in the original game that would otherwise cause a lock up when falling off the top of the tongue.

Developed using <a href="http://scicompanion.com/">SCI Companion</a>

Installation:

Copy pic.044 and script.044 into your KQIV game folder and start the game normally. Uninstall by removing the files.
